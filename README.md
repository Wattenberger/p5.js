# [p5.js](https://p5js.org)

Welcome! üëãüëãüèøüëãüèΩüëãüèªüëãüèæüëãüèº

p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.

Using the metaphor of a sketch, p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality using the HTML5 canvas element. You‚Äôre not limited to the drawing canvas though. You can think of your whole browser page as your sketch, including HTML5 objects for text, input, video, webcam, and sound.

p5.js draws inspiration, wisdom, and guidance from its precursor [Processing](https://processing.org). However, it is a new interpretation, not an emulation or port. We don't aim to match Processing's set of functionality exactly, allowing ourselves space to deviate and grow in the context of the web.

The [p5js.org](https://p5js.org) website contains an extensive overview of the project, community, documentation, and examples. If you already know the basics of JavaScript or Processing, the [p5.js overview](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/p5.js-overview) wiki page is a good place to start.

## Getting Started

Here's an example of a sketch:

<BlockComponent
  block={{"owner":"Wattenberger","repo":"blocks","id":"contributors","type":"file"}}
context={{"repo":"p5.js","owner":"wattenberger","path":".all-contributorsrc","sha":"HEAD","file":"README.md"}}
/>
To get started, [read the guide](/docs/01%20Getting%20started).

## Stewards

Stewards are contributors that are particularly involved, familiar, or responsive to certain areas of the project. Their role is to help provide context and guidance to others working on p5.js. If you have a question about contributing to a particular area, you can tag the listed steward in an issue or pull request. They may also weigh in on feature requests and guide the overall direction of their area, with the input of the community. You can read more about the organization of the project at [contributor_docs/organization.md](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/main/contributor_docs/organization.md).

Anyone interested can volunteer to be a steward! There are no specific requirements for expertise, just an interest in actively learning and participating. If you‚Äôre familiar with one or more parts of this project, open an issue to volunteer as a steward!

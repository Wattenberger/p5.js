# Get Started

This page walks you through setting up a p5.js project and making your first sketch.

In the sandbox to the right you should find the following code:

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
}
```

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
}
```

After `background(220)`; include this line of code: `ellipse(50,50,80,80)`.

---

The line you just added draws an ellipse, with its center 50 pixels over from the left and 50 pixels down from the top, with a width and height of 80 pixels.

> If nothing appears, the editor may be having trouble understanding what you’ve typed. If this happens, make sure that you've copied the example code exactly: the numbers should be contained within parentheses and have commas between each of them, the line should end with a semicolon, and ellipse has to be spelled correctly.

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  ellipse(50,50,80,80);
}
```

---


One of the most difficult things about getting started with programming is that you have to be very specific about the syntax. The browser isn't always smart enough to know what you mean, and can be quite fussy about the placement of punctuation. You'll get used to it with a little practice.

Next, we'll skip ahead to a sketch that's a little more exciting.

This program creates a canvas that is 400 pixels wide and 400 pixels high, and then starts drawing white circles at the position of the mouse. When a mouse button is pressed, the circle color changes to black. Move the mouse over the sandbox, and click to experience it.

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  if (mouseIsPressed) {
    fill(0);
  } else {
    fill(255);
  }
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 80, 80);
}
```
